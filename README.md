# ðŸ“š DSA Problems and My Solutions

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!

This project is a personal initiative to:
- Sharpen my problem-solving skills.
- Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for coding interviews and high-impact software engineering roles.
- Document my thought process, learnings, and optimizations along the way.

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here
- **Handpicked DSA Problems** across topics like Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Arrays, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **My Original Solutions** coded in Java.
- **Detailed Explanations** of logic and approach.
- **Time and Space Complexity** analysis for each solution.
- **Mistakes, Optimizations, and Learnings** recorded to continuously improve.
- **Future Improvements** tracked where possible.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java (Primary)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Additional Tools:** Markdown for documentation, GitHub for hosting

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Hashing
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Advanced Topics (Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)

---

## ðŸš€ How I Solve Each Problem
For each problem:
1. **Understand** the problem requirements and constraints.
2. **Plan** a strategy or multiple strategies.
3. **Implement** a clean, efficient solution.
4. **Analyze** the time and space complexities.
5. **Reflect** on mistakes and possible improvements.
6. **Optimize** wherever possible.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Vision
- Solve 500+ problems across all major platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GFG, etc.).
- Create pattern-based categorization (like sliding window, two pointers, binary search on answer, etc.).
- Build a searchable solution base (future automation: tagging + indexing).
- Contribute selected high-quality problems and solutions to open-source communities.
- Eventually evolve this into a **DSA Learning Roadmap + Personal Interview Preparation Kit**.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Matters
In the coming years, **problem-solving ability** will be even more critical with the rise of:
- AI-assisted development (developers who understand problems deeply will lead).
- Competitive product engineering.
- System design with efficient resource usage (time/memory).

Strong DSA skills are timeless â€” **and the best investment** in a long-term tech career.
